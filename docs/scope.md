# KidsConnect – Final Locked App Scope

## What the App Is
A matching-first mobile app that helps parents of children aged 0–6 discover and connect with other parents nearby, based on child compatibility, distance, and play style — without events, swipes, feeds, or social media mechanics.

Child-centric, parent-validated, safety-first.

## Core Principles
- No events / meetups / scheduling
- No swipe / likes / cards
- No public chatting
- Profiles drive everything
- Connections are intentional and gated
- Minimal personal data (safety > growth)

## Account & Access
- Phone required, email optional
- Community Rules checkbox mandatory at login
- One parent per account (for now)
- No public parent profiles (child profile is the discovery unit)

## Child Profile
Required:
- Child name (can be nickname)
- Age (0–6 only)
- Gender: Male / Female / Other
- City

Optional:
- Play-style badges (predefined)
- “Play-Space Available” toggle

Avatar rules:
- No child photos required
- Auto avatar palette by gender
- Photo allowed only after connection; if photo exists must include parent (no solo child photos)

## Discovery
- City → Map (default) → List (toggle)
- One active city at a time; GPS used once to unlock city; manual selection allowed
- Map shows jittered approximate positions (area-level, not exact)
- List is simple rows (not cards)
- Sorting: distance + age closeness + other factors
- Filters are soft (re-rank, never hide)
- Soft end message when results finish

## Connection Model
- One-way request with short message (~150 chars)
- Cannot message unless connected
- Pending expires after 14 days
- Decline blocks re-request for 30 days
- No ignore (Accept/Decline only)
- Daily request cap: 10

## Post-Connection
- Text-only chat (no media/calls)
- Safety note shown once at top of chat
- Chat opens only from inside connected profile
- “Chat” button visible pre-connection prompts request flow

## Blocking & Reporting
- Report: predefined reasons + optional text; auto-blocks immediately; full invisibility both ways
- Block: full invisibility both wa
