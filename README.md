- Validate flows, rules, and UX
- Test safety-first connection logic
- Share and review screens easily via browser
- Prepare for a future Flutter build (separate repo)

## What this prototype is NOT
- Not a production app
- No real users or persistence
- No events, feeds, or social mechanics
- No payments or monetization

## Tech baseline (locked)
- Web-based, mobile-only
- Plain HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS
- Static JSON data
- No framework, no build step
- Hosted via GitHub Pages

## How to view
The app is intended to be viewed via **GitHub Pages** on a mobile-sized screen.
